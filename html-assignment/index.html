            <p>My name is Abel Roney; I am enrolled in Algonquin college for Interactive Media Design as an international student. I come from Kerala, which is a state at the southern tip of India. I completed my bachelor’s in engineering from Karunya University, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India, after that I worked for Tenneco Automotive ltd. as a manufacturing engineer. After a couple of years, I felt dried up and didn’t find the motivation to continue in my field, so I switched careers and joined an NGO where I was a part of their media team.
            </p>
            <P>As a teen, media always fascinated me as a source that could inspire millions. When I was given the opportunity to follow my passion, I grabbed onto it the first chance I got. A couple of years into the media industry, I have found that I lacked certain skill sets and my information based was scattered; That’s when I came across the IMD program at Algonquin College. This program was diverse and covered all the parts of media communication. With this degree under my belt, I’m sure I would earn a competitive edge over my peers. That’s my story and how I have ended up here.
