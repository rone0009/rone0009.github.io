            <!--&emsp adds four spaces-->
            <p>
                &emsp; My name is Abel Roney; I am enrolled as a 1<sup>st</sup> year student at Algonquin college for Interactive Media Design. I come from Kerala, which is a state at the southern tip of India. I completed my bachelor’s in engineering from Karunya University, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India, after that I worked for Tenneco Automotive <abbr title="Private">Pvt.</abbr> <abbr title="Limited">Ltd.</abbr>, as a manufacturing engineer. After a couple of years, I <em>felt</em> dried up and lacked the <em>motivation</em> to continue in my field; so I switched careers and joined an NGO, where I was a part of their media team.

            <P>
                &emsp; As a teen, media always fascinated me as a source that could <em>inspire</em> millions. When I was given the opportunity to follow my passion, I <em>grabbed</em> onto it the first chance I got. A couple of years into the media industry, I realised that I <em>lacked</em> certain skill sets and my information based was <em>scattered</em>; That’s when I came across the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program at Algonquin College. This program was <em>diverse</em> and covered all major parts of media communication. With this degree under my belt, I’m sure I would earn a <em>competitive edge</em> over my peers. That’s my story and how I have ended up here.
            </P>
